    Storage 
    Storing the design templates for the UI creation when making on netbeans swing
    Just to document and store the image files or other files I might need, but shouldnt be
    included in the main application files. This branch should never be merged, and later deleted
    down the line when the UI is fully created and implemented. Might add database schema examples and
    Feature descriptions to have it down in writing.
